# Colours++

## About this project...
Colours++ is a application to visualise impossible colours made as part of a school Science project. This application is not for public distribution, but you can still look at it.

## Built with...
- Qt (C++ GUI framework)
- OpenGL (through Qt, for rendering)

## Getting started...
The application is quite small, so it will not take too long to develop. Once completed, a .exe file for x64 Windows will be available for running the application on your computer. If you want it on another platform, you can build it from the source code here.

### Prerequisites
Have a computer running Windows x64.

### Installation
Download the .exe from this repository onto your computer and run it directly.

To build it yourself for another platform, pls copy paste all the code here into a Qt project and build it using the latest version of Qt.

## Using the app...
You can view stygian, self-luminous, and hyperbolic impossible colours of your choice. The application contains clear instructions for usage. The application also contains an explanation of why the impossible colour is observed and the estimated RGB coordinates of the impossible colour. Note that impossible colours can have RGB coordinates exceeding the range [0, 255].

## What to expect...
- [x] choice of colour
- [ ] viewing impossible colours
:
	- [ ] stygian colours
	- [ ] self-luminous colours
	- [ ] hyperbolic colours
- [ ] scientific explanation
- [ ] RGB coordinates estimation
- [ ] report on RGB coordinates estimation algorithm

## Contact me...
I do not see why you would need to request changes to a graded school project.
